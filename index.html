        <h1>How have landmark educational policies changed the racial makeup of University of California?</h1>

        <p id = 'para'>The debate about policies aimed to increase diversity in higher education has been one of the most polarizing social issues in the United States.  For almost 4 decades, maintaining and increasing diversity at their campuses has been a top priority for the University of California system, which is home to some of the most applied to and prestigious public universities in the world. Yet, some landmark educational policies, such as the California ban of affirmative action in 1996, have only worsened the issue in more competitive campuses while leaving it mostly unresolved in the less competitive schools.</p>
        <br>
        <hr class="custom-hr">
        <h3>Education Policies Through the Years</h3>
        <p id="para"> We will specifically focus on two major policies: the 1996 affirmative action ban, as mentioned before, and the repeal of standardized testing (i.e. SAT and ACT) in 2020. Here's some more history (hover over <span style="color:red">standardized testing</span> policies in red, <span style="color:steelblue">affirmative action</span> in blue): </p>

        <h3>Diversity in University of California (2023)</h3>
        <p id="para"> The map displays the racial breakdown of the 2023 admitted class for each UC campus (click the logos): </p>

        <div id="map-container">

                From the map, we can already see some discrepancies that arise between the more competitive campuses and less competitive campuses.<br><br> For example, let's compare the most competitive UC campus, UCLA with a 9% acceptance  rate, to the least competitive campus, UC Merced with an 89% acceptance rate. UCLA, proportionally, has HALF the rate of Hispanic students than UC Merced. Even further, we can also see a much larger share of white students in UCLA than we do at Merced.

        </div>
        <p id="para"> When looking at the historical admissions data system wide and at each individual institution, one fact becomes apparent: educational policies have different effects at institutions of different calibers. Prior to the repeal of affirmative action in California, we see that the racial makeup of competitive institutions, like UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD, to be similar to the racial makeup of California high school graduating classes. In 1996-2000, when the ban on affirmative action went into effect, we saw clear drops in admission rates among African American, Hispanic/Latino(a), and American Indian students in these schools. Over time, we see the rates of Hispanic/Latino(a) students return to their pre-affirmative action levels, but it is likely that this can be attributed to a larger share of Hispanic/Latino(a) people in California. While we do see some recovery around 2001 when UC decided to implement holistic admissions review, we do not see this same recovery among African American and American Indian students.</p>
        <p id="para"> The most recent major policy changeâ”€the removal of standardized testing from applicationsâ”€seems to show growing rates of admitted students from underrepresented racial groups, however it is still unclear what the long term effects will be on demographic trends. Research also shows that standardized testing scores are key predictors of success in higher education, so increased admission may not necessarily equate to increased success or retention for admitted students across all races.</p>
        <br>
        <hr class="custom-hr">
        <h3>The Importance of Diversity in Higher Education</h3>
        <p id="para">Diversity in higher education is extremely important in the movement towards achieving equity across racial groups in the United States. It is a key step in ensuring greater chances of success and socioeconomic mobility for an individual, which is why it is critical for members of marginalized groups to have equitable access to admission at an institution of any caliber and prestige. But diversity is not solely beneficial to students of underrepresented groups; research has shown that studentsâ€™ exposure to people different from themselves gain cognitive benefits, such as improved critical thinking skills and problem solving ability, which will aid in better navigation of American society and culture in the future. Furthermore, students gain valuable social and cultural competencies by interacting with peers of different backgrounds. </p>
        <p id="para">Therefore, understanding the effects of educational policy on racial demographics is necessary to identify the best ways to promote diversity and improve accessibility for marginalized groups. With further insights into the ways these policies shape student bodies across institutions, we can inform future policy decisions that foster greater diversity and equity in higher education. </p>
